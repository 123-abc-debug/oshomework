Memory Management
Implement a memory management strategy based on Segmentation, simulate
memory allocation and deallocation processes, observe and analyze the resulting
external fragmentation, and understand its underlying causes. The specific
requirements are as follows:
(1) Write in C/C++. (2) Randomly simulate multiple memory allocation requests. (3) Conduct in-depth analysis of the simulation results..
